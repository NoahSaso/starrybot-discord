# Queenbot


## NOTES

1) For the discord bot I ended up using discord.js - there are some tutorials on the web here. You basically start out on the discord website and register your bot, then you write a small nodejs app that has to run forever, that handles user events.

2) I generated some test art here for the bot logo: https://customneon.com/create-neon-sign/

3) You have to kind of approve the bot - this is how you do that: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=911363833925349456&scope=bot&permissions=8

4) I spun up a gcloud instance to run the bot forever....

5) I also threw it on a github at https://github.com/anselm/queenbot
